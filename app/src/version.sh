#         'Epichrome apps can now be edited by dropping them on Epichrome.app!' \
#         'Added advanced settings during app creation and editing to control how the app handles updates, and to customize its ID' \
#         'New unified app engine architecture for better compatibility with the dock, notifications, and other system services' \
#         'Added two new apps, "Epichrome Scan.app" and "Epichrome Login.app" to restore apps left in an unlaunchable state after a crash' \
#         'Checking GitHub for updates is now unified across all apps and Epichrome itself, so when a new update is found, you will only receive one notification' \
#         'Many more improvements and bug fixes (see change log on GitHub for details)' )
   # Apps are now automatically backed up whenever they are edited or updated (in the Backups subfolder of the app's data directory)
   #
   # ▪️ Fixed a problem that could cause apps to register as a browser after update even though they were created not to (existing apps that should not be registered browsers will need to be edited once to reset that setting)
   #
   # ▪️ Updated built-in engine to Brave 1.13.86
